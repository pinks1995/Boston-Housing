# Predicting Boston Housing Prices
This Project aims at predicting the housing prices in Boston using Machine Learnig. This project is part of Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program. This project is designed to get us equipped with the many techniques available for training,testing,evaluating and optimizing models available in SKLEARN.

# Install 
This project requires Pyton and the following python libraries to be installed

*Numpy
*Pandas
*Scikit Learn
*matplotlib

 You must also acquaint yourself with how  Jupiter Notebook work.

# Code
The ipython notebook called boston_housing.ipynb contains the template code and answers to questions that were to be answered as part of review of the project.
The dataset being used is in housing.csv file. 

# Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory boston_housing/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook boston_housing.ipynb
or

jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

# Data
The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Features

RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
LSTAT: percentage of population considered lower status
PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
Target Variable 4. MEDV: median value of owner-occupied homes
